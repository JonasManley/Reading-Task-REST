# Reading-Task-REST

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

* In year 2000, the software engineer and researcher <a href=https://roy.gbiv.com/>Roy Fielding</a> published his <a href=https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm>PhD thesis</a>, entitled: <br>
Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, in which he introduced and defined the concept behind the now so popular abbreviation REST.

<br>

<h2>Read the document and try to find the answers of the following questions:</h2>

**1. What exactly is REST? How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?**

* REST stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. 
When a REST webservice (REST API) is called, the server will transfer a representation of the state of the requested resource to the client. <br>
E.g. if you ask Facebooks API about a specific user, you will get the whole state: username, name, birthday, emial etc.


**2. Why is the dissertation considered so important for the software-architectural world?**

* "A key advantages of REST API is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied either resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats. This flexibility allows developers to build an API that meets your needs while also meeting the needs of very diverse customers."

* They are **Stateless**: REST APIs are stateless, which means that every call can be made independently of one another, and contains all of the data necessary to complete itself successfully.

* Unlike SOAP, REST is not constrained to return data in XML, but instead can return XML, JSON, YAML or any other format depending on what the client requests.

**3. Which is the most valuable outcome you personally get from it?**
* They are easy to use & create and works very well in applications that handles different data and data requests.

**4. How could you implement it in your own practice as a software developer?**
* use them as much as posible?
